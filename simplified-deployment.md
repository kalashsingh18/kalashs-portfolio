# Simplified Vercel Deployment

If you're still experiencing issues with deployment, here's a simplified approach that often works for Next.js projects with complex dependencies:

## 1. Remove Custom Configuration

First, remove any custom configuration that might be causing issues:

1. Delete the `vercel.json` file
2. Revert to the standard `next.config.js` file
3. Remove any custom build scripts from `package.json`

## 2. Use Vercel's Default Settings

Deploy using Vercel's default settings, which are optimized for Next.js:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Use the default settings during deployment
4. If you encounter dependency issues, add the following Override in the Vercel dashboard:
   - Go to Project Settings > General > Build & Development Settings
   - Set Install Command to: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps --force`

## 3. Use Static Export (If All Else Fails)

If you're still having issues, you can try using Next.js static export:

1. Update your `next.config.js`:
   ```javascript
   /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
   const nextConfig = {
     output: 'export',
     images: {
       unoptimized: true,
     },
   };
   
   module.exports = nextConfig;
   ```

2. Update your `package.json` build script:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "build": "next build && next export"
   }
   ```

3. Deploy to Vercel using these settings

This approach will generate a static site without server-side rendering, which is often easier to deploy but may limit some functionality.

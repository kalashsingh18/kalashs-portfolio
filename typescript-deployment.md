# Deploying Next.js with TypeScript to Vercel

This guide addresses common TypeScript-related issues when deploying to Vercel.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

1. **Ensure TypeScript dependencies are installed**:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/node @types/react-dom
   ```

2. **Verify tsconfig.json is properly configured**:
   - Make sure it includes all necessary files
   - Check that the configuration is compatible with Next.js

3. **Check for type errors locally**:
   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push your code to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix TypeScript configuration"
   git push
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - Go to the Vercel dashboard
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Use the following settings:
     - Framework Preset: Next.js
     - Build Command: (leave default)
     - Install Command: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps --force`
     - Output Directory: (leave default)

3. **Monitor the build logs**:
   - Watch for any TypeScript-related errors
   - If you see errors, check the specific files mentioned

## Common TypeScript Issues

### Missing Type Declarations

If you see errors about missing types, add them to your project:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/package-name
```

### Strict Type Checking

If you're getting errors due to strict type checking, you can:

1. Fix the type issues (recommended)
2. Temporarily set `"strict": false` in tsconfig.json

### Module Resolution Issues

If you're having issues with module resolution:

1. Make sure the module is installed
2. Add a declaration file (like types.d.ts) for any missing module types
3. Check import paths for case sensitivity

## After Deployment

Once deployed successfully, make sure to:

1. Test all functionality on the live site
2. Check the browser console for any runtime errors
3. Verify that all TypeScript components are rendering correctly
